TODO:
  separate thread for rendering

Sequence flow:
  GUI can call EDITING
  EDITING can call RENDERING, MEDIA
  RENDERING can call MEDIA

Instructions:
  GUI can never see the entities within EDITING (only retrieve generic data or EDITING DTO)
  EDITING can never see the entities within RENDERING or MEDIA (only retrieve generic data)
  The module RENDERING must be independent from other modules (it can know MEDIA but that's it)
  Use DTO (class with only data, no methods / logic) to communicate from EDITING to RENDERING

Coding conventions:
  PEP8 convention
  no encoding declaration
  indent using spaces
  max length of 79 characters and docstring/comments to 72 characters
  clear meaning of each variable name, avoid abbreviations
  variables, functions: snake_case
  classes: CamelCase
  avoid built-in names
  modules: lowercase, short descriptive names, with no underscores
  sub_modules: with underscore
  type hints and function annotations (e.g. def function(sequence: dict[int: str]) -> int:)
  create CustomExceptionError classes using Error suffix
  define constants in SHOUTING_CASE at the module level
  2 blank lines before class, 1 before method
  imports in blocks (standard, related ext lib, local app) separated by 1 blank line
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions
  comment in full sentences with first capital
  block comments are sentences ending with period, using #, and aligned with following code
  add inline comments only when necessary
  write docstrings for public methods
  capitalize acronyms in CamelCase (NP, HTTP...)
  dont use properties or decorators for getter and setter
  private variables and methods: _var, _function
  conflicting built-in names: var_
  class methods use cls argument
  always make private if public not needed
  no getters setters for simple public attributes
  dont concatenate string with +
  derive CustomExceptions from Exception and not BaseException
  use str.endswith(".ext") to check extensions
  always use isinstance when checking types
  add variable type hints
